# What's left to be done

1. Figure out what's going on with the theme in Material UI. It's applying itself somewhat sporadically
2. FULL TEST SUITE
3. React Router
4. Redux
5. Secure the config vars
6. Dockerize
7. Set up a pipeline to deploy
8. Add a linter
9. Add pages and mechanisms to create new cast/director/origin/genre
10. Make components more modular. I ended up with some very large and gross components
11. WebSockets to push updates to clients
